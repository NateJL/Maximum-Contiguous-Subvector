# Maximum-Contiguous-Subvector
Python program implementing and analyzing 5 different algorithms to find the maximum contiguous subvector in an array.

## Introduction
This program implements the different solutions of the maximum
contiguous subvector problem, compares the run times for the different implementations, and plots the
run times for different size arrays. There are five
algorithms to implement: one cubic, two quadratic, one linear and one
divide and conquer.
