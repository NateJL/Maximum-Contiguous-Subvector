# Maximum-Contiguous-Subvector
Python program implementing and analyzing 5 different algorithms to find the maximum contiguous subvector in an array.

## Introduction
This program implements the different solutions of the maximum
contiguous subvector problem, compares the run times for the different implementations, and plots the
run times for different size arrays. There are five
algorithms to implement: one cubic, two quadratic, one linear and one
divide and conquer.

## Instructions
The <b>max_subarray.py</b> file contains the five algorithms that will be calculate the maximum contiguous subvector given an array.

The <b>driver.py</b> file is used to measure the run-times of each algorithm. The driver takes two arguments: the name
of the method for the algorithm and the size of the array to test. The command
to run <b>driver.py</b> from the command line is:

'python driver.py name of algorithm XXXX'

where 'name of algorithm' is a method definition in <b>max subarray.py</b> and 'XXXX'
is an integer to specify the size of the array to test on. The output of the driver
program is the maximum sum returned from the method you called from the
command line as well as the time it took for the algorithm to run in seconds.
